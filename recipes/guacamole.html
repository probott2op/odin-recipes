    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Guacamole</strong> is a classic Mexican dip made primarily from ripe avocados, known for its creamy texture and fresh, vibrant flavors. It is a staple in Mexican cuisine and is widely enjoyed around the world as a flavorful accompaniment to a variety of dishes. The base of guacamole is mashed avocado, which can be prepared to a smooth or chunky consistency, depending on personal preference. The rich, buttery taste of the avocado forms the perfect canvas for a blend of complementary ingredients.</p>

    <p>Traditional guacamole includes fresh lime juice, cilantro, tomatoes, red onion, and often a bit of chili or jalapeño for a touch of heat. Lime juice adds a refreshing tang and helps preserve the green color of the avocado, while cilantro brings a bright, herbal note. Tomatoes contribute a juicy sweetness, and onions or garlic enhance the savory depth of the dip. The addition of salt ties all the flavors together, creating a balance of creamy, tangy, spicy, and savory elements that make guacamole irresistibly delicious.</p>

    <p>Whether served as a topping for tacos, nachos, or burritos, or as a dip with crispy tortilla chips, guacamole is a versatile dish that can be easily customized to suit different tastes. Some variations even include ingredients like corn, pomegranate seeds, or fruit like mango, adding additional textures and flavors. Despite its simplicity, guacamole has become a beloved favorite around the world, offering a refreshing and satisfying addition to any meal or gathering.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ripe avocados (peeled, pitted, and mashed)</li>
        <li>1 lime (juiced)</li>
        <li>1 small red onion (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>1 medium tomato (seeded and diced)</li>
        <li>1-2 jalapeños (seeds removed and finely chopped, adjust to your preferred spice level)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh cilantro (chopped)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Black pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>Optional: 1 garlic clove (minced)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Avocados</strong>: Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh into a medium-sized bowl. Use a fork or potato masher to mash the avocado to your desired consistency—smooth or chunky.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Lime Juice</strong>: Squeeze the juice of one lime over the mashed avocado. This adds a tangy flavor and helps prevent the avocado from browning.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix in the Vegetables</strong>: Add the finely chopped red onion, diced tomato, chopped jalapeños, and cilantro to the mashed avocado. Stir everything together to combine. If you like a little extra kick, you can add more jalapeños or a pinch of chili powder.</li>
        <li><strong>Season</strong>: Add salt and black pepper to taste. If you want to add an extra savory depth, you can also mix in minced garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>Taste and Adjust</strong>: Taste your guacamole and adjust the seasoning, adding more lime juice, salt, or pepper as needed. If you like it a bit spicier, feel free to add more jalapeño or chili.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong>: Once your guacamole is well-mixed and seasoned to your liking, serve it immediately with tortilla chips, tacos, nachos, or any other dish of your choice. For a fresher taste, enjoy it right away, but if you need to store it, cover the surface with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
    Enjoy your homemade guacamole! It's a simple, flavorful dip that's perfect for any occasion.
