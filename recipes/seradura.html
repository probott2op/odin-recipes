        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> <strong>Seradura</strong>, also known as <em>Macau-style pudding</em> or <em>Serradura</em>, is a popular, no-bake dessert originating from Macau, a special region of China known for its blend of Portuguese and Chinese influences. The name "Seradura" comes from the Portuguese word *seradura*, meaning "sawdust," which refers to the appearance of the crushed biscuit layers in the dessert.</p>

        <p> This indulgent treat features alternating layers of crushed Marie biscuits (or digestive biscuits) and a smooth, sweet cream filling made from whipped heavy cream and sweetened condensed milk. The result is a dessert that's wonderfully creamy, with the biscuits providing a crunchy contrast that adds texture and richness. Often chilled for several hours or overnight, Seradura becomes more cohesive and sets into a dense, velvety consistency, making it perfect for serving in individual cups or as a large layered dessert.</p>

        <p>The simplicity of the ingredients—mostly pantry staples—belies the indulgence and deliciousness of the dessert. Seradura is often enjoyed as a light yet satisfying ending to a meal and is loved for its ease of preparation, making it a favorite in many households, especially for casual gatherings or festive occasions.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Marie biscuits</strong> (or digestive biscuits) – around 200g, crushed</li>
            <li><strong>Sweetened condensed milk</strong> – 1 can (approximately 397g)</li>
            <li><strong>Heavy whipping cream</strong> – 250ml</li>
            <li><strong>Powdered sugar</strong> – 2-3 tablespoons (optional, depending on your sweetness preference)</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla extract</strong> – 1 teaspoon (optional, for added flavor)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Crush the biscuits</strong>: Place the biscuits in a food processor or put them in a plastic bag and crush them into fine crumbs.</li>
            <li><strong>Whip the cream</strong>: In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. If you like a sweeter flavor, you can add powdered sugar during this process.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix condensed milk</strong>: In another bowl, mix the sweetened condensed milk and vanilla extract (if using) together.</li>
            <li><strong>Layering</strong>: In a glass dish or individual serving cups, start with a layer of crushed biscuits, followed by a layer of the whipped cream mixture. Repeat until you have used up all the ingredients, ending with a layer of whipped cream on top.</li>
            <li><strong>Chill</strong>: Refrigerate the dessert for at least 4-6 hours (overnight is best) to let the flavors meld and the texture firm up.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve</strong>: Before serving, you can optionally sprinkle some more crushed biscuits or chocolate shavings on top for extra texture and flavor.</li>
        </ol>
