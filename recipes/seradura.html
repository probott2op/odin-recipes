        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> <strong>Seradura</strong>, also known as <em>Macau-style pudding</em> or <em>Serradura</em>, is a popular, no-bake dessert originating from Macau, a special region of China known for its blend of Portuguese and Chinese influences. The name "Seradura" comes from the Portuguese word *seradura*, meaning "sawdust," which refers to the appearance of the crushed biscuit layers in the dessert.</p>
        <p> This indulgent treat features alternating layers of crushed Marie biscuits (or digestive biscuits) and a smooth, sweet cream filling made from whipped heavy cream and sweetened condensed milk. The result is a dessert that's wonderfully creamy, with the biscuits providing a crunchy contrast that adds texture and richness. Often chilled for several hours or overnight, Seradura becomes more cohesive and sets into a dense, velvety consistency, making it perfect for serving in individual cups or as a large layered dessert.</p>
        <p>The simplicity of the ingredients—mostly pantry staples—belies the indulgence and deliciousness of the dessert. Seradura is often enjoyed as a light yet satisfying ending to a meal and is loved for its ease of preparation, making it a favorite in many households, especially for casual gatherings or festive occasions.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Marie biscuits (or digestive biscuits) – around 200g, crushed</li>
            <li>Sweetened condensed milk – 1 can (approximately 397g)</li>
            <li>Heavy whipping cream – 250ml</li>
            <li>Powdered sugar – 2-3 tablespoons (optional, depending on your sweetness preference)</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract – 1 teaspoon (optional, for added flavor)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Crush the biscuits: Place the biscuits in a food processor or put them in a plastic bag and crush them into fine crumbs.</li>
            <li>Whip the cream: In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. If you like a sweeter flavor, you can add powdered sugar during this process.</li>
            <li>Mix condensed milk: In another bowl, mix the sweetened condensed milk and vanilla extract (if using) together.</li>
            <li>Layering: In a glass dish or individual serving cups, start with a layer of crushed biscuits, followed by a layer of the whipped cream mixture. Repeat until you have used up all the ingredients, ending with a layer of whipped cream on top.</li>
            <li>Chill: Refrigerate the dessert for at least 4-6 hours (overnight is best) to let the flavors meld and the texture firm up.</li>
            <li>Serve: Before serving, you can optionally sprinkle some more crushed biscuits or chocolate shavings on top for extra texture and flavor.</li>
        </ol>
