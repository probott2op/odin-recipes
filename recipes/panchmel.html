    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Dal Panchmel</strong> is a flavorful and hearty dish from Rajasthani cuisine, known for its rich blend of five different types of lentils. The name "Panchmel" comes from the word <em>"panch"</em>, meaning five, and <em>"mel"</em>, meaning mixture. This delicious, protein-packed dal combines the earthy flavors of a variety of lentils, resulting in a hearty and wholesome dish that is both comforting and nutritious.</p>

    <p>The five lentils traditionally used in Dal Panchmel are <strong>toor dal (yellow pigeon peas)</strong>, <strong>moong dal (yellow split mung beans)</strong>, <strong>masoor dal (red lentils)</strong>, <strong>chana dal (split chickpeas)</strong>, and <strong>urad dal (black gram)</strong>. These lentils are cooked together with a variety of aromatic spices, including <strong>cumin</strong>, <strong>coriander</strong>, <strong>turmeric</strong>, <strong>garam masala</strong>, and <strong>asafoetida (hing)</strong>. The dal is typically tempered with <strong>ghee (clarified butter)</strong>, which imparts a rich and luxurious flavor, along with fried <strong>garlic</strong>, <strong>ginger</strong>, and <strong>green chilies</strong> for an added punch of heat and flavor. The dish is often garnished with fresh coriander leaves and served with <strong>roti</strong> (Indian flatbread) or <strong>rice</strong>.</p>

    <p>Dal Panchmel is a staple in Rajasthani households and is often enjoyed as part of a larger meal. It offers a perfect balance of flavors—earthy, spicy, and slightly tangy, with the ghee enhancing its richness. The combination of lentils not only gives it a complex and satisfying taste but also makes it an excellent source of protein, making it a wholesome and fulfilling vegetarian dish. Whether enjoyed for lunch or dinner, Dal Panchmel is a comforting, nourishing, and flavorful dish that showcases the vibrant culinary traditions of Rajasthan.</p>

        <li><strong>Toor dal (yellow pigeon peas)</strong> – 1/4 cup</li>
        <li><strong>Moong dal (yellow split mung beans)</strong> – 1/4 cup</li>
        <li><strong>Masoor dal (red lentils)</strong> – 1/4 cup</li>
        <li><strong>Chana dal (split chickpeas)</strong> – 1/4 cup</li>
        <li><strong>Urad dal (black gram)</strong> – 1/4 cup</li>
    
        <li><strong>Ghee (clarified butter)</strong> – 2 tablespoons (or oil, if you prefer)</li>
        <li><strong>Cumin seeds</strong> – 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li><strong>Asafoetida (hing)</strong> – a pinch</li>
        <li><strong>Ginger</strong> – 1-inch piece, finely grated</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic</strong> – 4-5 cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li><strong>Green chilies</strong> – 2, slit lengthwise</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato</strong> – 1 large, chopped (optional)</li>
        <li><strong>Turmeric powder</strong> – 1/2 teaspoon</li>
        <li><strong>Red chili powder</strong> – 1/2 teaspoon (optional)</li>
        <li><strong>Garam masala</strong> – 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li><strong>Coriander powder</strong> – 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong> – to taste</li>
        <li><strong>Water</strong> – about 4-5 cups (adjust for desired consistency)</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh coriander leaves</strong> – for garnishing</li>
        <li><strong>Lemon juice</strong> – 1 tablespoon (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Wash and Soak the Lentils</strong>: Rinse all the lentils (<strong>toor dal</strong>, <strong>moong dal</strong>, <strong>masoor dal</strong>, <strong>chana dal</strong>, and <strong>urad dal</strong>) thoroughly under cold water. Soaking the lentils for 30 minutes to 1 hour can help them cook faster and make the dal more tender, but it's optional.</li>
    
        <li><strong>Cook the Lentils</strong>: In a large pot or pressure cooker, add the soaked lentils and <strong>4-5 cups of water</strong>. Bring the water to a boil and cook the lentils until they are soft and fully cooked. If using a pressure cooker, cook for about <strong>3-4 whistles</strong>, then turn off the heat and let the pressure release naturally. If cooking in a regular pot, it may take 20-25 minutes. Mash the cooked dal slightly to break it up, but leave it somewhat chunky for texture.</li>
    
        <li><strong>Prepare the Tempering (Tadka)</strong>: Heat the <strong>ghee (clarified butter)</strong> (or oil) in a pan over medium heat. Add the <strong>cumin seeds</strong> and let them splutter. Add the <strong>asafoetida (hing)</strong> for extra flavor. Stir in the grated <strong>ginger</strong>, <strong>garlic</strong>, and slit <strong>green chilies</strong>, frying for 2-3 minutes until they turn golden and fragrant. Add the chopped <strong>tomatoes</strong> (if using) and cook until they soften and blend into the mixture. Then, add the <strong>turmeric powder</strong>, <strong>red chili powder</strong>, <strong>coriander powder</strong>, and <strong>garam masala</strong>. Stir well and cook for another 2 minutes to let the spices bloom.</li>
    
        <li><strong>Combine the Dal and Tempering</strong>: Add the cooked lentils to the pan with the tempering. Stir everything together and simmer for 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. If the dal is too thick, you can add more <strong>water</strong> to achieve your desired consistency.</li>
    
        <li><strong>Season and Garnish</strong>: Add <strong>salt</strong> to taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. You can also squeeze in a bit of <strong>lemon juice</strong> at this point for added tang. Garnish with fresh <strong>coriander leaves</strong>.</li>
    
        <li><strong>Serve</strong>: Serve the Dal Panchmel hot with steamed <strong>rice</strong> or Indian bread (<strong>roti</strong>, <strong>naan</strong>, or <strong>paratha</strong>). It’s perfect as a main dish for lunch or dinner, and you can pair it with a side of pickles or a yogurt-based salad for added flavor.</li>
